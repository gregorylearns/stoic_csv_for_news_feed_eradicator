# stoic_twitter_bot
This is a twitter bot that posts a stoic quote once daily, using a .csv file of quotes I created via web scraping goodreads.com  This program runs once daily using Task Scheduler. I plan to update the code and using both apscheduler and Heroku to have this bot be truly automated.
